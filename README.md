### Introduction

We did a salary analaysis of different data science related jobs in different industries, cities, states, etc versus other industries, cites, states, etc.

The data was fetched from Glassdoor based on the availables jobs on the platform and further it was cleaned and made ready for EDA (Explorataory Data Analysis). In our EDA, we found Machine Learnig Engineers were the most paid of all, after the director, even the manager. Senior Data Scientist were also well payed off. The full EDA is mentioned in the project documnet.

The data we are using for our model was scrapped from Glassdoor using the keyword ‘Data Science’, and have scrapped a thousand jobs posting related to data science field/industry. The data includes the expected salary of the employee, the type of the job, the location of the job, the company type, the industry sector, the age of the company and the description of the job including what skills were repeated and emphasized in most of the jobs posting such as Python, Spark, R-studio, AWS and Excel.
